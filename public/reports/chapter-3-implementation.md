**Foreign Key Relationships**
- Participants belong to houses (participants.house_id → houses.id)
- Events are based on sports (events.sport_id → sports.id)
- Results link events, participants, and houses
- Profiles can be linked to houses for captains

**Data Integrity Constraints**
- NOT NULL constraints on essential fields
- CHECK constraints for valid status values
- UNIQUE constraints where appropriate
